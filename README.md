They vow to live a healthier lifestyle together and what better way to start a health transformation by starting from the inside out ; their dietary habits. It just so happens that Ah Boy and Chi Ling both recently learned about the food pyramid in school, however they are overwhelmed by the amount of different food types that are available, and how much they should be eating each food type, ranging from the healthiest like rice, vegetables, chicken to the most unhealthy such as processed foods and carbonated drinks.
